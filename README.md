2+ examples of things you enjoyed about or learned from this project
1. Carlos - I learned to be confident in my REST API implementation skills, I had trouble with the moviedatabase and was terrified to 
handle this food related API. Suprisingly this API was easier to implement thanks to our previous task in the class.
2. Neil - Getting more familiar with css and making pages look more interesting than barebones html

2+ examples of things you didnâ€™t enjoy or wanted to learn from this project
1. Carlos - One thing I didnt enjoy about the project was that it was great idea, but there wasn't enough time to complete the website as planned. The website is great and is unique for people who dont know what to make for food but could have better features.
2. Neil - Similarly for me, time constraints/conflicts with other classes and projects prevented us from meeting together early on and working on the project for any extended amount of time.
